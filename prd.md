### **Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Employee Assistant Chatbot**

**Version 2.0 - Current Implementation Status**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements and **current implementation status** for an internal AI-powered chatbot designed to serve as a comprehensive support and training tool for UOB Relationship Managers. The primary goal is to enhance employee knowledge, improve skills through coaching, and provide a realistic training environment. The chatbot operates in three distinct modes: Knowledge Mode, Coaching Assistant Mode, and Simulation Mode.
