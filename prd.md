### **Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Employee Assistant Chatbot**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for an internal AI-powered chatbot designed to serve as a comprehensive support and training tool for employees. The primary goal is to enhance employee knowledge, improve skills through coaching, and provide a realistic training environment. The chatbot will operate in three distinct modes: Knowledge Mode, Coaching Assistant Mode, and Simulation Mode.

**2. Problem Statement**

Employees, particularly in sales and customer-facing roles, need immediate and accurate access to a vast amount of information, including product details, internal processes, and compliance regulations. Traditional training and knowledge bases can be time-consuming to navigate and lack practical, on-the-job application. There is a need for a dynamic tool that not only provides information but also actively helps employees develop their skills and confidence in a controlled environment.

**3. Goals & Objectives**

* **Improve Knowledge Access:** Provide instant, accurate answers to deep and complex questions about products and processes.
* **Enhance Employee Skills:** Offer active coaching, competitive insights, and best-practice suggestions.
* **Standardize Performance:** Ensure all employees operate with a consistent and high level of knowledge and adherence to company standards.
* **Provide Realistic Training:** Allow employees to practice customer interactions in a safe, simulated environment with actionable feedback.
* **Increase Efficiency:** Reduce the time employees spend searching for information, allowing them to focus more on their core tasks.

**4. User Personas**

* **New Employee:** Needs to quickly learn company products, processes, and rules. Benefits most from the Knowledge and Simulation modes to build a strong foundation.
* **Experienced Employee:** Needs a quick reference for complex or niche scenarios, competitive information, and a way to refine their skills. Benefits most from the Knowledge and Coaching modes.

**5. Features & Requirements**

The chatbot will be accessible via a user-friendly interface and will feature three core functional modes:

---

#### **Feature 1: Knowledge Mode**

    * It should be capable of simplifying complex functions and providing easy-to-understand explanations.
* **1.2. Centralized Knowledge Base:**
    * The chatbot must be powered by a comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge base containing:
        * Complete product portfolio information.
        * Official company rules, regulations, and compliance guidelines (Reference Docs: PDF License pages 1, 2, 3-6, 17-19).
        * Step-by-step guides for standard operating procedures.
* **1.3. Case Overview Generation:**
    * The system should be able to provide a summary of how to approach a case based on initial parameters like sales type, product, and preliminary customer information.
* **1.4. [Optional] Strategic Guidance:**

* **2.2. Key Phrase & Keyword Suggestion:**
    * The chatbot must be able to identify and suggest impactful keywords and talking points for each product to use in customer conversations.
* **2.3. Scenario-Based Guidance:**
    * The user can ask hypothetical questions like, "What should I do if a customer has this problem?" The system should provide a structured, advisable course of action.
    * The system should be able to handle "trick questions" or difficult customer objections.
* **2.4. Response Formulation:**
    * The chatbot should be able to suggest or predict potential answers to customer queries, allowing the employee to review, fix, and finalize the response.

#### **Feature 3: Simulation & Training Mode**
*Objective: To provide a realistic role-playing environment for employees to practice and receive feedback.*

* **3.1. Realistic Customer Simulation:**
    * The system must be able to generate and role-play as a virtual customer.
    * Simulations should start with a basic customer profile and progress to matching them with the appropriate product through conversation.
* **3.2. Dynamic Conversation Flow:**
    * The simulation must support a full, interactive dialogue.
    * **Advanced Requirement:** The virtual customer should be able to simulate realistic voice and emotions (e.g., curiosity, frustration, satisfaction) to create a more immersive training experience.
* **3.3. Performance Feedback & Scoring:**
    * Upon completion of a simulation, the system must provide a performance report that includes:
        * Constructive feedback on the user's performance.
        * A quantitative score based on predefined metrics (e.g., product knowledge, compliance, conversational effectiveness, adherence to VDB/APU standards).

**6. Success Metrics**

* **User Adoption Rate:** Percentage of target employees actively using the chatbot weekly.
* **Task Completion Time:** Reduction in the average time it takes for an employee to find specific information.
* **Performance Improvement:** Measurable increase in simulation scores over time for individual employees.
* **Qualitative Feedback:** Positive ratings and feedback from employee satisfaction surveys.
* **Business Impact:** Correlation with improved sales metrics, customer satisfaction scores (CSAT), or reduced compliance errors.
